                    A passionate web developer, UI/UX designer, and Java expert.
                    With a love for technology and a creative mindset, I strive
                    to create stunning and user-friendly websites and
                    applications that leave a lasting impact. My expertise in
                    web development allows me to bring ideas to life, while my
                    skills in UI/UX design ensure a seamless and enjoyable user
                    experience. I'm always up for a coding challenge and love
                    finding innovative solutions to complex problems.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But that's not all! When I'm not busy coding, I'm an avid
                    gamer who enjoys exploring virtual worlds and competing with
                    fellow gamers. It's a great way to unwind and stay connected
                    with the gaming community.

                    During my college days, I had the honor of being the captain
                    of the coders club. Leading a team of talented individuals
                    and organizing coding competitions was an incredible
                    experience that further fueled my passion for technology and
                    collaboration.
